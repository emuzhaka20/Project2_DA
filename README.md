# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes student academic performance based on various socio-demographic factors and support programs. The dataset contains information on students' gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch status, and whether they completed a test preparation course — along with their scores in math, reading, and writing.

The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns, highlight disparities, and identify potential predictors of academic success.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:
- `gender`: Gender of the student (binary encoded)
- `race_ethnicity`: Student's ethnic group
- `parental_level_of_education`: Highest education level of the student's parents
- `lunch`: Type of lunch received (encoded)
- `test_preparation_course`: Whether the student completed a prep course (binary)
- `math_score`, `reading_score`, `writing_score`: Individual test scores
- `total_score`: Sum of the three scores
- `average_score`: Mean score across all subjects


## 📌 Key Findings and Insights
- The average scores are similar to a normal distribution with the most common results being in the range between 60-80.
- A certain gender performed slightly better than the other one with around 3-5 points more on average(survey was gender annonymous)
- Regarding the ethnicity of the participants there were no big differences except group E performing better than all(survey was ethnicy annonymous)
- Based on the parent´s level of education it is noticed that participants whose parents had a bachelor´s or master´s degree performed better on average(master´s slightly better)
- Eating lunch before the exam showed to have a positive effect on the participants, around 6-8 more points on average
-Taking a test preparation course showed far better results rather than not doing anything. 
    
    
## ✅ Final Conclusion
- Based on all the findings and insights reported above, even though participants have no control over most of them, my suggestion for a better score would be to take a preparation course and have lunch before the exam
